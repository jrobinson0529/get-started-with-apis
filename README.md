# Get Started with APIs

When you are new to development, often you will hear other devs talk about APIs and you may be wondering what they are and may even be a little intimidated.

This repo is a few handpicked API lessons you can do to get familiar with some simple APIs and their docs.

## Get Started
- [Download Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- Start a new project using the [Webpack Template](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-14/webpack-template)
- Go ahead and create an account and an API Key on the Open Weather API because it takes a couple of hours for the API Key to kick in and doing so will mean the key will be ready when you are ready.

## Quick Projects
Start with the first project and work down the list. DO NOT SKIP!
